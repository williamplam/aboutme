            "content_html": "<p>Back in 2015, we heard about an incredibly novel competition called World Robot Olympiad where kids build their robots in the morning and then compete in the afternoon of a single day competition. Entranced by the idea, we entered the competition with two teams, Exit 5 Robotics and Exit 5A Robotics. Because we didn't have a local WRO qualifier in NJ we had to go through an video submission for one team and travel to NY for the other team to compete against another team. </p>\n<p>In 2016, we had a similar qualifying experience and realized that NJ needed a qualifier. With the NJ robotics landscape of FLL, FTC, VIQ, and VEX, I started laying the groundwork for an entirely new to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NJ competition that was WRO</a>. </p>\n<p>From securing the venue (<a href=\"https://lsc.org/\">Liberty Science Center</a>), to enlisting a bevy of about 15 enthusiastic volunteers, creating trophies, and so much more... we were able to find 11 interested teams to compete in the inaugural <a href=\"https://lsc.org/news-and-social/news/lsc-hosts-state-wide-world-robot-olympiad-competition\">NJ WRO Qualifier in 2017</a>. Following the <a href=\"https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FLL </a>qualifier model, NJ WRO was powered entirely by unpaid volunteers and has been the case every year since.</p>\n<p>Building upon that initial success, we grew the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/videos/2018-wro-nj-qualifier-lsc-world-robot-olympiad-liberty-science-center-new-jersey/2312470459017018/\">2018 NJ WRO Qualifier </a>by about 40% out to 18 teams and 20+ volunteers from local FLL, FTC, and VEX teams. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/videos/2019-wro-nj-qualifier-lsc-world-robot-olympiad-liberty-science-center-new-jersey/391237661577242/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019 NJ WRO Qualifier </a>grew again by about 40% to 33 teams and almost 40 volunteers.</p>\n<p>There was just so much to learn in all this from the dedicated volunteers from <a href=\"https://www.livingstonrobotics.org/\">Livingston Robotics Club</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ftc10582/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emerald Knights</a>, <a href=\"https://lsc.org/\">LSC</a>, and so many other groups. That included providing opportunities for young adults to try new responsibilities they had never experienced before. I don't know if there is any greater joy than watching a kid DJ for the first time, seeing a 15 year old find their voice to become a commanding emcee by days end, or witnessing a budding content creator's first event highlight video. </p>\n<p>The 2020 &amp; 2021 NJ WRO events were COVID cancellations and we fully expect to be back and running NJ WRO in 2022!  </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://scontent.fewr1-5.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.18172-8/c0.132.1200.1200a/s851x315/20689534_1540340146026619_8808665828578666884_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=da31f3&amp;_nc_ohc=YTGal72OsQsAX9VEvCI&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fewr1-5.fna&amp;tp=28&amp;oh=7c4ae712b688f99046f6c51ca0441b63&amp;oe=608D3D14\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"2017 NJ WRO\" width=\"315\" height=\"315\">\n<figcaption >2017 NJ WRO</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Not all women STEM heroes are engineers, scientists, doctors, or mathematicians. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She’s a STEM hero because I grew up watching her fix literally everything or attempt to fix everything in the restaurant.

YouTube instructional videos and 800 toll free support numbers didn’t exist. She magically seemed to know how to do everything. She was 1st line technical support for a 40 employee business.

I didn't know what that meant and she explained that if you try hard enough, you can figure out most things on your own.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I credit my parents for encouraging her to do this. For not following stereotypes that girls can’t do this, or girls shouldn’t do that. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Five years later as a 10 year old and with my sister off to college, I now had to fix everything. She inspired me to have the confidence to do the job and have the common sense to get things resolved.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today with a family of my own, I wanted to provide the same hands-on problem solving opportunities for my daughters and that led to the formation of all-girls robotics teams, Exit 5 and Exit 5A Robotics </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEM heroes for women aren’t always obvious science teachers, talented engineers, famous women. STEM heroes are everyday people. My sister who fixed everything. My mom and my dad who didn’t care about stereotypes of the times. They are STEM heroes. </span></i></p>",

We have been blessed with highly motivated kids and passionate kids strive to do their very best individually and as team members, resulting in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">55 team awards, with 10 at the national/international level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning takes place in three locations: our makerspace, robotics competition venues, and STEM outreaches to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of our teams work in our makerspace programming robots, and discussing teamwork, good stewardship, and core values of who/what we are. At robotic competition venues, students learn the merits of teamwork as they pair up to compete against other pairs of teams. Until COVID19 hit, our teams typically complete about 10 outreaches per year to help promote robotics and STEM to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a BSEE, MS-IT, and MBA, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked small startups ranging from small startups to technical behemoths like AT&amp;T Bell Labs. In my daytime endeavors, I meet amazing engineers around the world who have a passion for making the best possible products. With the last 16 years years in technical sales I have had the privilege of meeting talented adults living our their dreams designing and bringing to market some incredible products. I <a href=\"https://williamplam.github.io/aboutme/how-did-i-get-here.html\">grew up </a>and started working in our family restaurant at age 7 and learned the value of hard work and giving back to the community through leadership and mentorship.
