                <p>Back in 2015, we heard about an incredibly novel competition called World Robot Olympiad where kids build their robots in the morning and then compete in the afternoon of a single day competition. Entranced by the idea, we entered the competition with two teams, Exit 5 Robotics and Exit 5A Robotics. Because we didn't have a local WRO qualifier in NJ we had to go through an video submission for one team and travel to NY for the other team to compete against another team. </p>
<p>In 2016, we had a similar qualifying experience and realized that NJ needed a qualifier. With the NJ robotics landscape of FLL, FTC, VIQ, and VEX, I started laying the groundwork for an entirely new to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NJ competition that was WRO</a>. </p>
<p>From securing the venue (<a href="https://lsc.org/">Liberty Science Center</a>), to enlisting a bevy of about 15 enthusiastic volunteers, creating trophies, and so much more... we were able to find 11 interested teams to compete in the inaugural <a href="https://lsc.org/news-and-social/news/lsc-hosts-state-wide-world-robot-olympiad-competition">NJ WRO Qualifier in 2017</a>. Following the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/ways-to-help/volunteer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLL </a>qualifier model, NJ WRO was powered entirely by unpaid volunteers and has been the case every year since.</p>
<p>Building upon that initial success, we grew the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/videos/2018-wro-nj-qualifier-lsc-world-robot-olympiad-liberty-science-center-new-jersey/2312470459017018/">2018 NJ WRO Qualifier </a>by about 40% out to 18 teams and 20+ volunteers from local FLL, FTC, and VEX teams. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/videos/2019-wro-nj-qualifier-lsc-world-robot-olympiad-liberty-science-center-new-jersey/391237661577242/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 NJ WRO Qualifier </a>grew again by about 40% to 33 teams and almost 40 volunteers.</p>
<p>There was just so much to learn in all this from the dedicated volunteers from <a href="https://www.livingstonrobotics.org/">Livingston Robotics Club</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ftc10582/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emerald Knights</a>, <a href="https://lsc.org/">LSC</a>, and so many other groups. That included providing opportunities for young adults to try new responsibilities they had never experienced before. I don't know if there is any greater joy than watching a kid DJ for the first time or seeing a 15 year old find their voice to become a commanding emcee by days end.</p>
<p>The 2020 &amp; 2021 NJ WRO events were COVID cancellations and we fully expect to be back and running NJ WRO in 2022!  </p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young 5 year old by growing up in a family restaurant, I had a STEM hero, although I didn’t know it at the time. Today, I can confidently say that my STEM hero was ... </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My 14 year old sister. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world needs more people like my sister. Not all women STEM heroes are engineers, scientists, or doctors, or mathematicians. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a STEM hero because I grew up watching her fix literally everything or attempt to fix everything in the restaurant. I’d find her with a noisy blender completely taken apart or other times fixing a broken can opener</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that this was back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. YouTube instructional videos and 800 toll free support numbers didn’t exist. She magically seemed to know how to do everything. She was 1st line technical support for a 40 employee business. As a 5 year old I looked up in awe at her and followed her everywhere.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I asked how she knew all this. She responded “Common sense”. Somehow, she just figured out how things worked and never accepted failure. She had the confidence to try and was not afraid of failure. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit to my parents for encouraging her to do this. For not following stereotypes that girls can’t do this, or girls shouldn’t do that. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years later as a 10 year old with my sister off to college, I now had to fix everything. She inspired me to have the confidence to do the job, to have the find the common sense to get things resolved.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we had our first daughter in 2001, I didn’t run a family restaurant like my parents, but wanted to provide the same opportunities for my daughters, so we started all-girls robotics teams, Exit 5 and Exit 5A Robotics </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEM heroes for women aren’t always obvious science teachers, talented engineers, famous women. STEM heroes are everyday people. My sister who fixed everything. My mom and my dad who didn’t care about stereotypes of the times. They are STEM heroes. </span></i></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of my day job as a global sales manager for a technology company, I have TONS of fun helping others in STEM endeavors. Along for this journey are a wonderfully supportive partner, 3 great children, and other fantastic like-minded parents. This incredible group has enabled the initiation of endeavors including 28 robotics teams, 50+ outreach events, Women In Engineering Day at Liberty Science Center <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1722414561152509&amp;type=3">2018 </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2230502767010350&amp;type=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a>, NJ World Robot Olympiad (WRO) competitions <a href="https://lsc.org/news-and-social/news/lsc-hosts-state-wide-world-robot-olympiad-competition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/videos/2018-wro-nj-qualifier-lsc-world-robot-olympiad-liberty-science-center-new-jersey/2312470459017018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=391237661577242">2019</a>. Although COVID robbed us of the 2020 &amp; 2021 events, we are planning to come back strong in 2022 with both of Women In Engineering Day and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NJWRO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NJ WRO</a>. To restart that momentum, we created the non-profit American Robotics Open Championship entity this year to help advance opportunities for young STEM'ers across the country in this COVID age (check back for update on this!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a volunteer coach for neighborhood robotics teams since 2010, I've had the honor of working with 63 talented kids through 130+ competition events spanning 28 robotics campaign seasons. We have been blessed with great kids that aspire for greatness and have won over 55 awards, with 10 at the national level. In my daytime endeavors, I meet amazing engineers around the world who have a passion for making the best possible products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning takes place in three locations: our makerspace, robotics competition venues, and STEM outreaches to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of our teams work in our makerspace programming robots, discussing teamwork, good stewardship, and core values of who/what we are. At robotic competition venues, students learn the merits of teamwork as they pair up to compete against other pairs of teams. Until COVID our teams typically complete about 10 outreaches per year to help promote robotics and STEM to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a BSEE/MS-IT/MBA and my first job was at AT&amp;T Bell Labs, but have spent the last 16 years years in technical sales. I <a href="https://williamplam.github.io/aboutme/how-did-i-get-here.html">grew up </a>and started working in our family restaurant at age 7 and continued helping for the next 22 years. I saw how difficult life was for people without college degrees. Although not in full time philanthropy, I have always had a desire to help others.</span></p>
