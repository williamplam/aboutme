                <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a young 5 year old by growing up in a family restaurant, I had a STEM hero, although I didn’t know it at the time. Today, I can confidently say that my STEM hero was ... </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My 14 year old sister. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world needs more people like my sister. Not all women STEM heroes are engineers, scientists, or doctors, or mathematicians. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a STEM hero because I grew up watching her fix literally everything or attempt to fix everything in the restaurant. I’d find her with a noisy blender completely taken apart or other times fixing a broken can opener</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that this was back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. YouTube instructional videos and 800 toll free support numbers didn’t exist. She magically seemed to know how to do everything. She was 1st line technical support for a 40 employee business. As a 5 year old I looked up in awe at her and followed her everywhere.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I asked how she knew all this. She responded “Common sense”. Somehow, she just figured out how things worked and never accepted failure. She had the confidence to try and was not afraid of failure. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit to my parents for encouraging her to do this. For not following stereotypes that girls can’t do this, or girls shouldn’t do that. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years later as a 10 year old with my sister off to college, I now had to fix everything. She inspired me to have the confidence to do the job, to have the find the common sense to get things resolved.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we had our first daughter in 2001, I didn’t run a family restaurant like my parents, but wanted to provide the same opportunities for my daughters, so we started all-girls robotics teams, Exit 5 and Exit 5A Robotics </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEM heroes for women aren’t always obvious science teachers, talented engineers, famous women. STEM heroes are everyday people. My sister who fixed everything. My mom and my dad who didn’t care about stereotypes of the times. They are STEM heroes. </span></i></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a volunteer coach for neighborhood robotics teams since 2010, I've had the honor of working with 63 talented kids through 130+ competition events spanning 28 robotics campaign seasons. We have been blessed with great kids that aspire for greatness and have won over 55 awards, with 10 at the national level. In my daytime endeavors, I'm a global sales manager for a technology solutions company, where I meet amazing engineers around the world who have a passion for making the best possible products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning takes place in three locations: our makerspace, robotics competition venues, and STEM outreaches to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of our teams work in our makerspace programming robots, discussing teamwork, good stewardship, and core values of who/what we are. At robotic competition venues, students learn the merits of teamwork as they pair up to compete against other pairs of teams. Until COVID our teams typically complete about 10 outreaches per year to help promote robotics and STEM to underrepresented and disadvantaged communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a BSEE/MS-IT/MBA and worked at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. In the last 16 years years have been in technical sales. I grew up and started working in our family restaurant at age 7 and continued helping for the next 22years. I saw how difficult life was for people without college degrees. Although not in full time philanthropy, I have always had a desire to help others.</span></p>
